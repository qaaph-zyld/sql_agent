**Previous State:** Analysis scripts created but encountering dependency and connection issues
**Current State:** Virtual environment established with proper proxy configuration for dependency installation

#### Changes Made:
- Created Python virtual environment for isolated dependency management
- Configured pip to use corporate proxy (104.129.196.38:10563) for package installation
- Installed required packages: pymssql, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy, python-dotenv
- Created standalone analysis script for RCT-WO transactions with proper column names
- Generated SQL queries for analyzing RCT-WO transactions from the last month
- Implemented HTML report generation with transaction summaries and detailed tables

#### Files Affected:
- Created `venv/` directory with virtual environment
- Created `analysis/rct_wo_analysis/standalone_analysis.py`
- Created `analysis/rct_wo_analysis/results/` directory for output files

#### Technical Decisions:
- Used direct database connection with pymssql instead of SQLAlchemy for simplicity
- Corrected column names based on actual database schema (tr_qty_chg instead of tr_qty, etc.)
- Implemented both text and HTML output formats for flexibility in reporting
- Used parameterized date ranges for dynamic analysis of the last complete month

#### Next Actions Required:
- Run the standalone analysis script to generate the complete report
- Review the analysis results and visualizations
