## Critical Path Elements

1. Database schema extraction → Query engine development → Query validation
2. Natural language processing → SQL generation → Result formatting
3. Testing framework → Performance optimization → Deployment readiness

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Schema complexity | High | Medium | Progressive implementation with prioritized entities |
| Query accuracy | High | Medium | Comprehensive test suite with edge cases |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Early performance testing and optimization cycles |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security-first development approach |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Modular architecture with clear interfaces |
