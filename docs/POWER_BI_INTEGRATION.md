# Power BI Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for integrating the Data Quality Reports with Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Prerequisites

- Power BI Desktop installed
- Access to the reports directory
- Basic understanding of Power BI

## Step 1: Set Up Data Sources

1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Click on "Get Data" > "Excel"
3. Navigate to the reports directory
4. Select the detail report Excel files (e.g., `missing_cost_detail_*.xlsx`)
5. Click "Load" to import the data

## Step 2: Create Data Model

1. In Power BI Desktop, go to "Model" view
2. Create relationships between related tables if needed
3. Add calculated columns or measures as required
4. Create date tables for trend analysis

## Step 3: Create Visualizations

### Dashboard 1: Overall Data Quality Summary

1. Create a card visual showing total issues by category
2. Add a bar chart showing issues by group
3. Include a trend line showing issues over time
4. Add filters for date range, plant, and issue type

### Dashboard 2: Cost and Routing Issues

1. Create a table showing items with missing cost information
2. Add a matrix showing missing routing by group and plant
3. Include a pie chart showing distribution by item type
4. Add drill-through functionality to see detailed item information

### Dashboard 3: Inventory Analysis

1. Create a treemap showing inventory value by group
2. Add a scatter plot comparing inventory value vs. movement
3. Include a gauge showing slow-moving inventory percentage
4. Add filters for ABC classification and item type

### Dashboard 4: BOM Structure Issues

1. Create a table showing items with product line and group issues
2. Add a matrix showing EPIC status items by group
3. Include a bar chart showing operation check issues by plant
4. Add drill-through functionality to see detailed item information

### Dashboard 5: Cycle Count and Slow-Moving Analysis

1. Create a table showing items due for cycle count
2. Add a matrix showing slow-moving items by age category
3. Include a bar chart showing inventory value by movement age
4. Add filters for ABC classification and item type

## Step 4: Set Up Automatic Refresh

### Option 1: Scheduled Refresh with Gateway

1. Install Power BI Gateway on a server with access to the reports directory
2. Configure the gateway to connect to the data sources
3. Publish the report to Power BI Service
4. Set up scheduled refresh in Power BI Service

### Option 2: Direct Database Connection

1. Create a direct connection to the SQL Server database
2. Implement the report queries directly in Power BI
3. Publish the report to Power BI Service
4. Set up scheduled refresh in Power BI Service

## Step 5: Share and Distribute

1. Publish the report to Power BI Service
2. Create a workspace for the data quality reports
3. Set up row-level security if needed
4. Share the report with stakeholders
5. Set up email subscriptions for regular updates
