Based on your specific requirements for items where WIP_Qty <> 0, here are detailed visualization ideas for each of your requests:

## 1. Top 20 Item Numbers per WIP_Value

### **Horizontal Bar Chart with Data Labels**
- **Chart Type**: Horizontal bar chart (better for item number labels)
- **Key Features**:
  - Items sorted by WIP_Value descending
  - Item numbers on Y-axis, WIP_Value on X-axis
  - Data labels showing exact WIP_Value amounts
  - Color gradient from highest (dark) to lowest (light)
  - Hover tooltips showing additional details (Item Description, WIP_Qty, Standard Cost)

### **Enhanced Version - Pareto Chart**
- **Chart Type**: Combination of bar and line chart
- **Features**:
  - Bars show individual item WIP_Values
  - Line shows cumulative percentage
  - Helps identify the 80/20 rule in WIP value concentration
  - Clear demarcation of where the top items contribute most value

### **Implementation Tips**:
```sql
-- Sample filter for your data source
WHERE WIP_Qty <> 0
ORDER BY WIP_Value DESC
LIMIT 20
```

## 2. Pie Chart with Clear Labels of WIP_Value per Project

### **Enhanced Pie Chart with Outside Labels**
- **Chart Type**: Pie chart with exploded segments for top projects
- **Key Features**:
  - **Label Strategy**: Outside labels with leader lines to avoid overlap
  - **Value Display**: Show both percentage and absolute WIP_Value
  - **Color Scheme**: Distinct colors for each project, with a "Others" category for small projects
  - **Legend**: Interactive legend to filter/hide projects
  - **Threshold**: Group projects < 3% of total into "Others" category

### **Donut Chart Alternative**
- **Chart Type**: Donut chart with center summary
- **Features**:
  - Center displays total WIP_Value for all projects
  - Interactive segments that expand on hover
  - Click-to-drill down to see items within each project

### **Implementation Tips**:
```sql
-- Data preparation
SELECT 
    Project,
    SUM(WIP_Value) as Total_WIP_Value
FROM your_data
WHERE WIP_Qty <> 0
GROUP BY Project
HAVING SUM(WIP_Value) > 0
```

## 3. Pie Chart with Clear Labels of WIP_Value per Item Type

### **Multi-level Pie Chart (Sunburst)**
- **Chart Type**: Sunburst chart
- **Key Features**:
  - Inner ring: Item Type (FG/SFG/RM/No BOM)
  - Outer ring: Sub-categories or ABC classification
  - Hierarchical view of WIP value distribution
  - Click-to-drill functionality

### **Standard Pie with Enhanced Labels**
- **Chart Type**: Pie chart with smart label positioning
- **Features**:
  - **Label Format**: "Item Type: $X.XX (X%)"
  - **Smart Positioning**: Algorithm to prevent label overlap
  - **Interactive Legend**: Click to highlight/exclude specific item types
  - **Threshold Handling**: Auto-group small segments

### **Implementation Tips**:
```sql
-- Data preparation
SELECT 
    [FG/SFG/RM] as Item_Type,
    SUM(WIP_Value) as Total_WIP_Value
FROM your_data
WHERE WIP_Qty <> 0
GROUP BY [FG/SFG/RM]
```

## 4. Top 15 WIP_Values Grouped per Supplier

### **Stacked Bar Chart by Supplier**
- **Chart Type**: Stacked horizontal bar chart
- **Key Features**:
  - Suppliers on Y-axis (sorted by total WIP_Value)
  - Each bar segmented by top items within that supplier
  - Hover tooltips showing item details
  - Color coding by item type or project
  - "View More" option for suppliers with more items

### **Treemap Visualization**
- **Chart Type**: Treemap
- **Key Features**:
  - Large rectangles = suppliers (size = total WIP_Value)
  - Smaller rectangles within = individual items
  - Color intensity based on WIP_Value concentration
  - Hierarchical drill-down capability
  - Excellent for showing both supplier dominance and item distribution

### **Supplier Ranking Dashboard**
- **Chart Type**: Combination of card + bar chart
- **Features**:
  - Top 3 suppliers as KPI cards with their total WIP_Value
  - Bar chart showing remaining 12 suppliers
  - Supplier performance indicators (trend arrows)
  - Click-to-view detailed supplier breakdown

### **Implementation Tips**:
```sql
-- Data preparation
WITH SupplierWIP AS (
    SELECT 
        Item_Supplier,
        Item_Number,
        WIP_Value,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Item_Supplier ORDER BY WIP_Value DESC) as ItemRank
    FROM your_data
    WHERE WIP_Qty <> 0
)
SELECT 
    Item_Supplier,
    SUM(WIP_Value) as Total_WIP_Value,
    COUNT(*) as Item_Count
FROM SupplierWIP
GROUP BY Item_Supplier
ORDER BY Total_WIP_Value DESC
LIMIT 15
```

## **Additional Recommendations for All Visualizations:**

### **Consistency & Branding**:
- Use consistent color scheme across all charts
- Add company logo and dashboard title
- Include last refresh timestamp

### **Interactivity Features**:
- **Filters**: Date range, project, supplier, item type
- **Drill-down**: Click any segment to see detailed item list
- **Export**: Options to export charts as PDF/PNG
- **Share**: Email or link sharing capabilities

### **Accessibility**:
- High contrast color options
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Alternative text for all visual elements

### **Performance Considerations**:
- Implement data caching for better performance
- Use incremental loading for large datasets
- Add loading indicators for data refresh

### **Mobile Responsiveness**:
- Ensure all charts are mobile-friendly
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen size

These visualizations would work well in Power BI, Tableau, or any modern BI platform. The key is to ensure that the data is properly filtered for WIP_Qty <> 0 and that the visualizations are designed to provide clear, actionable insights at a glance.
